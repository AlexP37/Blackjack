# QUICK MENTIONS

Deck:

- There is 8 standard decks in the card pool (as per casino convention)
- The deck is shuffled after each new card pool (as per casino convention)

Split:

- You can split if you are delt two of the same cards and you bet amount is less than your total money (as per casino convention)
- Once you have split, you play through your first hand, and then your second (as per casino convention)

Double:

- Doubles the bet
- Hits one card
- Either Busts or Folds
- Note: as per casino convention, once a player doubles, their hand is automatically hit and then their turn ends, they either have a stand or a bust
- Must have enough money (more than your bet) to double

Placing Bet:

- Type your bet (you can only bet below your total money), and then press enter to place your bet.
- Bet can not exceed 10'000 (no exact casino max bet convention exists, but most casinos max bets are in the range of 1'000 - 50'000, so this simulator gives a standard bet limit of $10'000 which is considered as a general casino average)
- Pay to play rule applies (as per casino convention)

CPU Toggle and Demeanor:

- A button in the bottom right corner toggles the CPU on and off
- CPU's play through their hand visually and will take around 5 seconds (to allow for optimum comprehension), thus you may want to turn them off
- The deminer of CPU's can be changed by pressing the demeanor next to them. Passive will stand at 15, neutral will stand at 17, and assertive will stand at 19.

Win Conditions:

- 5 Under 21 is an instant win as long as the dealer doesn't also have 5 Under 21 (house rule)
- If you bust, it is an instant loss no matter what (as per casino convention)
- The highest value under 21 wins (as per casino convention)

User Actions:

- Click on the buttons and the defined feature will occur
- Buttons include Play, Light, Dark, Hit, Stand, Split, CPU, [CPU Demeanor], [Dark / Light Mode]

Colour Coding:

- Colours on the screen are perfectly intuative, but if any confusion arrised, see the below two points.
- The dealer is coloured based on you, the players result
- You, and the CPU's are coloured based on the result against the dealer
- Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle is in the bottom right corner

Out of Money:

- Once you run out of money, you can simply press the restart button that is displayed, and return to $100

A Footnote on Surrendering:

- "After receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: 'hit', 'stand', 'double down', or 'split'... SOME games give the player a fifth option, 'surrender'." - Wikipedia
- In only select casinos, and in only select games at afermentioned casinos can a player surrender / forfeit their hand for half of their bet back. 
- The vast majority of Vegas casinos for example do not offer surrender.
- Thus, for the above reasons and for contiguity's sake, the option for surrender is not offered in this simulator. EVERY SINGLE OTHER GAME FACTOR including 5 Under 21 is accounted for, but due to the abiguity of the surrender it is not included.

A Footnote on 5 Under 21:

- Just like 'surrender', 5 Under 21 is a lsightly ambiguos rule that is played in limited casinos, but in the majority of houshold games, the rule is respected.
- Due to the growing support of the rule, and the simplistic and well fashioned nature of its fundamentals, 5 under 21 is included in the game.
