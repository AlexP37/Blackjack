- Bet can not exceed 10'000 (no exact casino max bet convention exists, but most casinos max bets are in the range of 1'000 - 50'000, so this simulator gives a standard bet limit of $10'000 which is considered as a general casino average)
- Pay to play rule applies (as per casino convention)

CPU Toggle and Demeanor:
